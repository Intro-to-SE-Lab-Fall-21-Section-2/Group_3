We have decided to use the Python along with the Django Web Framework. We are undecided about what services or tools we will use to implement our SMTP and IMAP interfaces.

Users will need the ability to login into their profile and feel that their information is private. They will need to be able to compose, forward, reply, and attach attachemetns to their email. They will also need to be able to search through old emails in their inbox as well. The objective of the email client is for each function stated above to work properly and allow the user to get throught their tasks.
